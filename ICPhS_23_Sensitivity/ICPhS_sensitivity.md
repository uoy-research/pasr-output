# Sensitivity of x-vectors and automatic speaker recognition scores to vocal variation

This markdown file details the workflow for the ICPhS submission *Sensitivity of x-vectors and automatic speaker recognition scores to vocal variation* (include link if/when becomes available online)

## Data - x-vectors and tSNE plots

x-vectors were generated using the default VOCALISE x-vector model using MFCCs for P0001 (PF - 2022-11-22) and P0004 (FN - 2022-12-13).


## Data - scores and distributions

Within-speaker comparisons using the default x-vector PDLA comparison with minimum duration set to 10 seconds (*2021-XVector-Adaptable-20F-512-OCMS-02Nov2021*)
